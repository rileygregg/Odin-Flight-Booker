<h1>Search Flights</h1>

<%# This form is to search flights already created. Must search the url path, not the model, and method must be "get" as we are not inputting new data, only retrieving %>

	<%# Must use .map instead of .each when trying to manipulate each data point. Each would only be used to iterate through different points and show them %>
